  3.3 Changes

    The file structure from release 0.02 was restructured as follows:

       my $from = 'E:\User\SoftwareDiamonds\installation\lib\SVD\Military_STD2167A_0.02.pm';
        my $to = 'E:\User\SoftwareDiamonds\installation\packages\Military-STD2167A-0.02\lib\SVD\Military_STD2167A.pm';
       copy $from,$to;
       rmtree 'bin';
       rmtree 'lib\STD';
       rmtree 'lib\DataCop';
       rmtree 't\SVD';
       rmtree 't\STD';
       rmtree 't\DataCop';
       rmtree 't\DataCop';
       unlink 'lib\SVD\help.css';
       unlink 'lib\SVD\Military-STD2167A.html';
       unlink 'lib\SVD\Military-STD2167A.pm';
       unlink 'lib\SVD\SVD001.frm';
       unlink 'lib\SVD\SVDgen.pm';

    Changes are as follows:

    *   Changed the "VERSION" for Miltary-STD2167A.svd to 0.03.

    *   Removed STD and SVD modules and created separate distribution
        packages for these modules. This module is back to just the Military
        PODs.

    *   Minor formating changes for the VERSION and DATE at the top of the
        files.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. The
    installation instructions, hereinbelow, provides instruction on
    obtaining and installation UNIX utilities on Microsoft operating
    systems. There are no other additional or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

    The files may be installed under many different operating systems. The
    compresssed, archived, distribution file containing all installation
    files is at the following respository:

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t\STD2167A.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    None of the PODs contain any of the figures in the hard-copy versions.

     CDRL.pod
     CRISD.pod
     CSCI.pod
     CSOM.pod
     ECP.pod
     HWCI.pod
     IDD.pod
     SCN.pod
     SCOM.pod

    For Perl module releases, these documents may not be applicable. Many of
    them apply for establishing large software applications and complex
    systems involving both hardware and software while others establish
    format, legally binding, contractual requirements between the supplier
    and consumer of the data. Neither of these apply for this document.
